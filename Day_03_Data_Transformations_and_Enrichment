# Day 03 – Data Transformations & Enrichment in Databricks

This notebook is part of the **Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge**, focused on strengthening core data engineering skills using Databricks and Apache Spark through hands-on practice.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of Day 03 was to perform data transformations and enrich datasets using PySpark DataFrames, preparing raw data for downstream analytics and reporting.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Column-level transformations using `withColumn()`
- Applying conditional logic with `when()` and `otherwise()`
- Data type casting and formatting
- Handling null values using:
  - `dropna()`
  - `fillna()`
- Creating derived and calculated columns
- Renaming and restructuring columns
- Chaining multiple transformations efficiently
- Understanding immutability of Spark DataFrames

## 🧠 Key Learnings
Through this notebook, I learned:
- How Spark transformations are lazily evaluated
- Best practices for writing clean and readable transformation pipelines
- How data enrichment improves analytical usability
- Why transformation logic should be optimized early in data pipelines

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Databricks Community Edition
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Spark SQL

📌 This notebook represents **Day 03 progress** in my Databricks learning journey, guided by **Indian Data Club**, **Codebasics**, and **Databricks**.
