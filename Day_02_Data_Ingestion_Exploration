# Day 02 – Data Ingestion & Exploration in Databricks

This notebook is part of the **Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge**, focused on building strong foundations in data engineering using Databricks and Apache Spark through hands-on practice.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of Day 02 was to ingest structured datasets into Databricks, understand schema handling, and perform exploratory data analysis using PySpark DataFrames and Spark SQL.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Loading datasets into Databricks using PySpark
- Understanding schema inference vs. explicit schema definition
- Exploring DataFrames using:
  - `show()`, `count()`, `select()`
  - `filter()`, `distinct()`
  - `orderBy()`, `limit()`
- Performing basic aggregations
- Understanding Spark’s lazy evaluation model
- Creating temporary views for SQL analysis
- Running Spark SQL queries on ingested datasets

## 🧠 Key Learnings
Through this notebook, I learned:
- How Databricks efficiently ingests and manages structured data
- Why schema awareness is critical for performance and correctness
- The difference between Spark transformations and actions
- How PySpark and Spark SQL complement each other in analytics workflows

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Databricks Community Edition
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Spark SQL

📌 This notebook represents **Day 02 progress** in my Databricks learning journey, guided by **Indian Data Club**, **Codebasics**, and **Databricks**.
