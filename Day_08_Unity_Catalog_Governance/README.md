# Day 08 – Unity Catalog Governance

This notebook is part of the **Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge**, focused on understanding enterprise data governance using **Unity Catalog** in Databricks.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of Day 08 was to learn how **Unity Catalog** enables centralized governance, access control, and data discovery across Databricks workspaces.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Unity Catalog fundamentals
- Catalog → Schema → Table hierarchy
- Managed vs external tables
- Access control using `GRANT` and `REVOKE`
- Column- and object-level permissions
- Data lineage and impact analysis
- Creating governed views for controlled data access

## 🧪 Hands-on Tasks
- Created catalogs and schemas
- Registered Delta tables in Unity Catalog
- Configured permissions using `GRANT` and `REVOKE`
- Created views to restrict and control user access
- Explored data lineage between tables and views

## 🧠 Key Learnings
Through this exercise, I learned:
- How Unity Catalog centralizes governance across data assets
- Why the catalog → schema → table hierarchy is important
- The difference between managed and external tables
- How governed views enable secure data sharing
- How lineage improves trust, auditing, and impact analysis

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Databricks Community Edition
- Unity Catalog
- Delta Lake
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Spark SQL

📌 This notebook represents **Day 08 progress** in my Databricks learning journey, guided by **Indian Data Club**, **Codebasics**, and **Databricks**.
